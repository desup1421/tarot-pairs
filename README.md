# Tarot-pairs
This is a **Scratch** project which is made as final assigment from **Lumoshive Academy** for "Basic logic, algorithm, and basic programing" course.
## Gameplay
This is a memory-themed game where the user is shown a series of randomly arranged cards, which will then be flipped back. The user's task is to remember the position of the displayed cards and then match pairs of identical cards by clicking on cards with the same image consecutively. The game consists of 5 levels, and with each level, the number of cards to be matched increases.
